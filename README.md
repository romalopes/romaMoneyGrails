# Manual setup on CloudBees

Instructions for a manual setup with the [CloudBees SDK](http://wiki.cloudbees.com/bin/view/RUN/BeesSDK).

## Create a Tomcat6 container

```
bees app:create -a community/grails-petclinic-clickstart jvmPermSize=128
```

Please note the extra `jvmPermSize` for Grails framework.


## Create a MySQL Database

```
bees db:create community/grails-petclinic-clickstart
```

## Bind the MySQL Database to the Tomcat container

```
bees app:bind -a community/grails-petclinic-clickstart -db community/grails-petclinic-clickstart -as grails_petclinic
```

This binding injects in the container:

* System properties
  * `DATABASE_URL_GRAILS_PETCLINIC` starting with `mysql:` (e.g. "mysql://ec2-x-y-z-w.compute-1.amazonaws.com:3306/grails-petclinic-clickstart")
  * `DATABASE_USERNAME_GRAILS_PETCLINIC`
  * `DATABASE_PASSWORD_GRAILS_PETCLINIC`
* a JNDI datasource `java:comp/env/jdbc/grails_petclinic`

# Petclinic Sample Application

This is the standard introductory sample application for Grails. To get started with it, simply clone the repository and then from within your local copy run:

    ./grailsw run-app

on Unix-like systems, or

    grailsw run-app

on Windows via the command prompt. Once the server has started up, you can copy the URL and paste it in a browser.

Follow the tutorial link to learn about Grails or click on the View Source for Controller/View links to see the underlying code for whatever page you are currently on.
